android:text="(Recent Star Wars projects have been lacking in their acknowledgment of the Star Wars legends and itâ€™s incredibly dedicated/loyal fanbase, leading to a negative impact on profits for new Disney projects. In order to address this, I suggest that Disney incorporate a separate Legends timeline alongside the current Canon timeline. By doing so, they can appeal to a wider audience and increase profits. Here are a few examples of projects which could make use of this opportunity


Project number one

Title: Imperial Cadet Academy: Legends of the Star Destroyers

Synopsis:

The official Star Wars Instagram account introduces a new series of mock-class studies, giving followers a unique perspective into the technological advancements of the Galactic Empire's fleet. In "Imperial Cadet Academy: Legends of the Star Destroyers," users follow the POV of an imperial cadet who is tasked with learning about the empire's different class of star destroyer models.

The academy curriculum highlights the legends-only, never-before-seen models, allowing fans to discover a new chapter in the Star Wars universe. Each lesson delves into the special features, power systems, and capabilities of the star destroyers, drawing inspirations from existing Star Wars novels and stories.

Through an interactive and engaging social media format, the Instagram account will create a fully immersive environment that allows users to interact with the Star Wars universe in a new way. At the end of every lesson, quizzes will test user's knowledge and skills, with the potential to earn points and level up within the academy.

Projected Profit Value:

The project is expected to generate an additional $1.2 million in profit for the Lucasfilm production studios. The investment cost for the project is approximately   $200,000 to $300,000, and with the massive following of the Star Wars Instagram account, the project's success is highly anticipated.



Project number two

Title: Star Wars Comparison: Fan-Submitted Fleet Battles

Synopsis: Lucasfilm, in partnership with YouTube, introduces a new project called 'Star Wars Comparison' that allows fans to submit ideas for their dream fleet composition. The submitted ideas will be ranked based on a public poll, and the top two fleet compositions will be selected for a head-to-head battle. The battle will be showcased on a YouTube channel, inviting Star Wars fans to witness the outcome of the two fan-selected fleets. Fans will be allowed to participate by paying a two dollar fee to submit their fleet composition ideas.

Projected Profit Value: The project 'Star Wars Comparison' is expected to receive a high engagement rate from Star Wars fans, resulting in a projected profit value of 1.4 million dollars. The project will increase engagement, drive traffic to the YouTube channel, and generate revenue through the entrance fee cost.

Disclaimer: The reason that Lucasfilm should make use of the Instagram account and the YouTube page is because those are inexpensive platforms to release these first two projects on in the long run it will create a lot of profit for the company with minimal loss when it comes to where they have to put this new show. They don't have to waste their money putting it on Disney plus and  by putting it on these two places you make it more accessible to everyone even those who don't have Disney plus

Project number three

Title: Project Divergence: Exploring a New Branch in the Star Wars Universe

Synopsis: Project Divergence is a new venture that explores a new timeline in the Star Wars universe using the world between worlds from Star Wars Rebels. The project will start a new timeline after the events of Return of the Jedi, branching off into new territory based on the Star Wars Legends novels. The project will explore new stories, characters, and worlds based on the source material from the Legends novels. The project aims to create a diverse range of content, including video games, books, comics, movies, and merchandise.

Projected Profit Value: Project Divergence has a high potential for profit with a projected value of 1.2 billion dollars. The project aims to tap into the large and dedicated fanbase of Star Wars, providing them with new stories and content based on the Legends novels. The project aims to create a diverse range of content, catering to different audiences, and generating revenue through merchandise, movies, and other products. The project will set a new standard in the Star Wars universe, creating new and exciting stories for fans to enjoy.)"
